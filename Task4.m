%% TASK 4 - REFLECTIVE STATEMENT [5 MARKS]

% Reflective Statement:
% 
% Creating the temperature monitoring and control system was like embarking on an adventure, full of twists and turns, challenges, and moments of enlightenment. One of the biggest hurdles we faced was getting MATLAB to talk fluently with the Arduino board. It felt like unraveling a mystery at times, but with the help of detailed guides and online forums, we cracked the code and made it work.
% 
% Figuring out how to make the LEDs respond to temperature changes was another puzzle to solve. It required us to think like detectives, analyzing data and crafting logic that would make the LEDs act just right. It was a process of trial and error, but with each tweak, we got closer to our goal.
% 
% Despite the challenges, the project had its shining moments. We designed it to be flexible and easy to build upon, like building blocks that fit together seamlessly. And seeing the temperature data come to life on the live plot was nothing short of magical. It was like watching a story unfold before our eyes, with each data point revealing a new chapter.
% 
% Of course, no project is without its limitations. Relying on just one temperature sensor felt a bit like putting all our eggs in one basket. It got the job done, but we knew there was room for improvement. Maybe in the future, we'll add more sensors to make our system even smarter and more reliable.
% 
% Looking forward, there's still so much we want to do. We dream of refining our system, fine-tuning it to be even more precise and responsive. And who knows, maybe one day we'll take it wireless, giving it the freedom to roam and explore new horizons.
% 
% In the end, this project was more than just lines of code and circuits. It was a journey of discovery, a testament to our curiosity and determination. And as we look back on how far we've come, we can't help but feel excited for the adventures that lie ahead.
